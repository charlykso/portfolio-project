# <center>Portfolio Project</center>
TEAM
Names of team members: Ikenna Ezeanyaeji, Glory Chioma Anunah, Juliet Owanku.
 
ROLES:
Glory Chioma Anunah will be taking care of the front end with the inputs and contribution of the rest of the team members.
Juliet Owanku will take up the role of the back end with the input of other team members.
Ikenna Ezeanyaeji will take care of the flask and API.

Why have those roles been decided?
These roles were chiefly distributed to ensure the inclusiveness and participation of all the team members. More so, it is also based on the strength and competence level of each team member in different tech areas. While it is distributed with the intention of taking advantage of the strength of each team member, we also intend to use the execution of this project to strengthen our various weaknesses and overly improve greatly in our perceived weak areas as every team member will be carried along in every area so as to ensure thorough participation and learning through the course of this project execution.


TECHNOLOGIES
 Libraries: jQuery.
 Framework: flask API. 
Language: SQL, Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 
Platforms: Linux terminal, VS code etc. 
Hardware: HP 14 (8gb, 2.0gh, core i3) HP 2000 (8gb, 2.0gh, corei3)

The two technology choices                     we chose which are SQL and                   Flask API which can be substituted with web assembly and django 
We chose this technologies primarily for the sake that as tech newbies, these are the technologies we are currently working with and learning every of its functionality.
The following also explain why we chose the technologies:
Flask provides a structure for building web APIs, making it easier to organize code and handle common tasks such as routing and request handling. This can make development faster and more efficient.
 Python has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. This allows developers to easily add functionality to their API such as database connectivity, authentication, and more.
Python has built-in support for concurrent execution, which allows for handling multiple requests at the same time. This can make the API more responsive and handle more traffic.
Flask is a micro-framework, which means it is lightweight and flexible. This allows developers to choose the libraries and tools that they want to use, rather than being constrained by a monolithic framework.

CHALLENGE
The problem this project intends to solve: 
To bridge the gap between the property buyers and the sellers. 
To get rid of the long chain of property agent which mostly extort outrageously both the buyers and the sellers. 
Ensuring the authenticity of the properties, making sure they are linked to the legitimate owners.
Providing a platform for the owners to market the properties they intend to sell wich aims at bringing about cost reduction of properties as no extra charges are linked to any of the properties sold on this website. This will in turn help property owners sell their properties faster without the traditional stress and unnecessary delay. 
What the portfolio project will not solve: 
Auntentified.ng is not liable to verifying the present and future weather condition effects or other physical conditions on properties sold on the website as the buyers must inspect the present condition of properties and investigate the future durability of the property before buying.
 
Explain who this portfolio project will help/or who the users will be:
This project is intended to help every property owner intending to sell and anybody intending to buy properties. 

Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale?
No, it is not. On the other hand, it is quite universal as it can be adopted and used in different countries and regions to offer better property dealing to every individual.

RISKS
Technical risk: hacking into the database. 
Potential impact: external access to highly confidential information of users. 
Safeguard measures: hashing the password with MD5 using regex to ensure that users register with a strong password that must be up to eight alphanumeric characters including special characters.

Non-technical risk: the risk of someone registering as a property owner when he or she is not, with the intention to peddle fraudulent activities.
Potential impact: they could get to dupe buyers through those fraudulent accounts. 
Safeguard measures: verifying the authenticity of every property and the legitimacy of each owner, using the property number to query the state property database to confirm the legitimacy of every property and their owners, if the intended user detail appear to be unverifiable, the user will be restrained from having an account with Authentified.ng. 
Non-technical risk: A situation where one property could be sold to more than one buyer. 
Potential impact: loss of funds by the affected buyers. Loss of credibility of the website. 
Safeguard measures: every property sold on the site will be programmed to relate is present ownership status to the state database where it is updated instantly. 

INFRASTRUCTURE 
We will be using GitHub flow for our branching and merging, where different branches are created on the GitHub project repo so team members could execute their various tasks independently which will later be reviewed and merged.
Strategy for deployment: Our strategy for deployment will be gradual deployment with Github. 
How to populate our app with data: The database will be populated manually. 
Tool for testing: Unit tests will be used for testing.
