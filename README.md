# Portfolio-project - General over view
this project is a real estate web app with a unique functionalities which will bridge the gap between the property buyers and the sellers. To get rid of the long chain of property agent which mostly extort outrageously both the buyers and the sellers. Ensuring the authenticity of the properties, making sure they are linked to the legitimate owners. Providing a platform for the owners to market the properties they intend to sell wich aims at bringing about cost reduction of properties as no extra charges are linked to any of the properties sold on this website. This will in turn help property owners sell their properties faster without the traditional stress and unnecessary delay. What the portfolio project will not solve: Auntentified.ng is not liable to verifying the present and future weather condition effects or other physical conditions on properties sold on the website as the buyers must inspect the present condition of properties and investigate the future durability of the property before buying.
